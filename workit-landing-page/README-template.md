## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

How to centre any element in html using css code for margin.
How to use flexbox for different layouts on different screen widths.
How to position elements with Relative and Absolute Positioning.
How to position background image.

Some of the codes I'm proud of


```css
h1{
    font-family: 'Fraunces', serif;
   
    color: white;
    width: 500px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0 auto;
    
}

.sub-header{
    background-size: 160px;
    background-position-x: 0%;
    background-clip: border-box;
  }
```


### Continued development

The use of flexbox to create different layouts
